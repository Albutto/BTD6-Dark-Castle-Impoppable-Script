# BTD6-Dark-Castle-Impoppable-Script
Automatically starts and repeats impoppable on dark castle in BTD 6



The video tutorial used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mPJm1RF73g&t=189s&ab_channel=KKSTheMonke


Infrastructure and code taken from: https://github.com/Valokoodari/btd6-ahk/releases

One run lasts ~20 minutes and each impoppable game gives ~300k experience and 240 monkey money
This means that per hour you recieve 900k exp and 720 monkey money
In 24 hours, you will recieve 21.6m exp and 17,280 monkey money

THIS WILL NOT WORK ON OTHER MAPS (for now)
If an issue arises like a bug or consistent defeats my discord is Alcatraz#6375 and I am in the Valokoodari discord as well


Start the bot in the main menu or in the game and press ctrl + alt + shift + j to start the bot



Do not have a saved game in dark castle as that will break the bot




I am not sure how but I have managed to break the auto restart when a defeat happens. Since I have rarely experienced a defeat this hardly affects me but if you send me a solution, I will credit you in the next update and add the solution. Chances are, its easy but im too lazy currently.
